This section discusses the approach implemented in {\tt APFEL++} to
compute Mellin-convolution integrals. This kind of convolutions
appears very often in the presence of collinearly factorised
quantities as integrals over the longitudinal momentum fraction of
partons. This is for example the case of all cross sections in
collinear factorisation with hadrons in the initial and/or final
state. As a consequence, Mellin-convolution integrals also appear in
the DGLAP evolution equations. Also in transverse-momentum-dependent
(TMD) factorisation they play an important role when matching TMD
distributions onto the respective collinear ones. It is therefore of
central importance to put in place an efficient and accurate strategy
to numerically compute these convolutions. In doing so, it is also
important to take into account as much as possible all possible
flavours in which they may appear. For example, different variants
apply in the presence of heavy-quark masses or when considering
``non-forward'' integrals in the framework of exclusive physics.

\section{Structure of the integrals}

The general structure of the integrals considered in {\tt APFEL++} has
the form of a Mellin convolution between an \textit{operator} $O$,
this is a potentially complicated known function such as a splitting
function or a partonic cross section,\footnote{More precisely, $O$ is
  in general a distribution that may contain $\delta$ functions and
  $+$-distributions.} and a \textit{distribution} function $d$, as for
example a parton distribution function (PDF) or a fragmentation
function (FF). The explicit form of these integrals reads:
\begin{equation}
I(x) = x\int_0^1dz\int_0^1dy\, O(z)d(y)\delta(x-yz) =
x\int_x^1\frac{dz}{z} O \left(\frac{x}{z}\right) d(z) =
x\int_x^1\frac{dz}{z} O(z)d\left(\frac{x}{z}\right)\,.
\label{eq:ZMconv}
\end{equation}
Typically in the presence of mass effects, the integration phase space
may be modified and the convolution in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}) is
generalised as:
\begin{equation}
I(x,\eta) = x\int_{x/\eta}^1\frac{dz}{z} O(z,\eta)d\left(\frac{x}{\eta
    z}\right)\,,
\label{eq:Genconv}
\end{equation}
where $\eta\leq1$, with $\eta = 1$ reproducing
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}). However, it is convenient to rewrite the
integral in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv}) in a form in which the lower bound
of the integral is equal to $x$. This is easily done by performing the
change of variable $y =\eta z$, so that:
\begin{equation}
  I(x,\eta)= \int_x^\eta dy\,
  O\left(\frac{y}{\eta},\eta\right)\,\frac{x}{y}d\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)\,.
\label{eq:Genconv1}
\end{equation}

In order to enable the precomputation the expensive part of the
integral in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv1}), we use the standard interpolation
formula on the distribution $d$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{x}{y} d\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \sum_{\alpha=0}^{N_x} x_\alpha
d(x_\alpha) w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)\,,
\label{eq:Interpolation}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ runs over the nodes of a grid in $x$ and the weights
$w_{\alpha}$ are assumed to be Langrange polynomials of degree
$k$. Now we plug Eq.~(\ref{eq:Interpolation}) into
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv1}) and specialise the computation of the integral
$I$ to the girid point $x_\beta$. This gives:
\begin{equation}
  I(x_\beta,\eta)=  \sum_{\alpha=0}^{N_x} \overline{d}_\alpha\int_{x_\beta}^\eta dy\,
  O\left(\frac{y}{\eta},\eta\right)\,w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
where we have defined $\overline{d}_\alpha = x_\alpha d(x_\alpha)$.
As shown in the section devoted to the interpolation procedure, under
some specific conditions the interpolating functions are such that:
\begin{equation}
w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\neq 0\quad\mbox{for}\quad c < y < d\,,
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
  c =
  \mbox{max}(x_\beta,x_\beta/x_{\alpha+1}) \quad\mbox{and}\quad d =
  \mbox{min}(\eta,x_\beta/x_{\alpha-k}) \,.
\label{eq:intlims}
\end{equation}
Therefore, Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv1}) can be adjusted as:
\begin{equation}
  I(x_\beta,\eta)=  \sum_{\alpha=0}^{N_x} \overline{d}_\alpha\int_c^d dy\,
  O\left(\frac{y}{\eta},\eta\right)\,w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\,.
\label{eq:Genconv2}
\end{equation}
Finally, we change the integration variable back to $z=y/\eta$ so that
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv2}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
  I(x_\beta,\eta)=  \sum_{\alpha=0}^{N_x} \overline{d}_\alpha \underbrace{\left[\eta\int_{c/\eta}^{d/\eta} dz\,
  O\left(z,\eta\right)\,w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{\eta
      z}\right)\right]}_{\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}}\,.
\label{eq:Genconv3}
\end{equation}
To summarise, Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv3}) allows one to compute the
integral $I$ on the nodes of a given grid as a weighted sum of the
values of distribution $d$ on the nodes themselves. The weights are
given by the appropriate integral of the operator $O$ and the
interpolating functions $w_{\alpha}^{(k)}$. The value of $I$ for a
generic value of $x$ can finally be obtained by interpolation using a
formula similar to Eq.~(\ref{eq:Interpolation}). Importantly,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv3}) provides a fast way of computing convolution
integrals. Indeed, the weights $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}$ can be
precomputed and stored once and for all and the integral $I$ can be
quickly computed with different distributions $d$ by simply taking the
weighted average.

We now need an operational way to compute the weights
$\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}$. To do so, it is necessary to know the general
structure of the operator $O$. Quite generally, the operator $O$
splits as follows:
\begin{equation}
  O(z,\eta) = R(z,\eta)+\sum_{i}\left[P^{(i)}(z,\eta)\right]_+
  S^{(i)}(z,\eta)+ L(\eta)\delta(1-z)\,,
\label{eq:CoeffFuncs}
\end{equation}
where $R$ and $S^{(i)}$ are a regular functions at $z=1$, that is:
\begin{equation}
R(1,\eta) =  \lim_{z\rightarrow 1} R(z,\eta) = K(\eta)\quad\mbox{and}\quad S^{(i)}(1,\eta) =  \lim_{z\rightarrow 1} S^{(i)}(z,\eta) = J^{(i)}(\eta)\,,
\end{equation}
being $K$, $J^{(i)}$, and $L$ a finite function of $\eta$. The
functions $P^{(i)}$ are instead singular at $z=1$ and non-integrable
in the limit $\eta\rightarrow1$ and thus are regularised through the
$+$-prescription. Plugging Eq.~(\ref{eq:CoeffFuncs}) into the
definition of $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv3}) and
making use of the definition of $+$-prescription gives:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\Gamma_{\beta\alpha} &=& \eta\displaystyle \int_{c/\eta}^{d/\eta} dz\left\{R\left(z,\eta\right)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{\eta z}\right)+\sum_{i}P^{(i)}(z,\eta)\left[S^{(i)}\left(z,\eta\right)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{\eta z}\right)-S^{(i)}(1,\eta)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{\eta}\right)\right]\right\}\\
\\
&+&\displaystyle \eta\left[L(\eta)-\sum_{i}S^{(i)}(1,\eta)\int_0^{c/\eta}dz
    P^{(i)}(z,\eta)\right]w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{\eta}\right)\,,
\end{array}
\label{eq:FinalExpression}
\end{equation}
that can be further manipulated changing the integration variable into
$y=\eta z$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \Gamma_{\beta\alpha} &=& \displaystyle \int_{c}^{d} dy\left\{R\left(\frac{y}{\eta},\eta\right)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)+\sum_{i}P^{(i)}\left(\frac{y}{\eta},\eta\right)\left[S^{(i)}\left(\frac{y}{\eta},\eta\right)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)-S^{(i)}(1,\eta)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{\eta}\right)\right]\right\}\\
  \\
                       &+&\displaystyle \eta \left[L(\eta)+\sum_{i}S^{(i)}(1,\eta)Q^{(i)}\left(\frac{c}{\eta},\eta\right)\right]w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{\eta}\right)\,.
\end{array}
\label{eq:FinalExpression2}
\end{equation}
where we have defined:
\begin{equation}
  Q^{(i)}(a,\eta)\equiv-\int_0^{a}dz P^{(i)}\left(z,\eta\right).
\end{equation}
These integrals can, most of the times, be computed analytically.

Eqs.~(\ref{eq:FinalExpression})-(\ref{eq:FinalExpression2}) expose the
full potential complexity of the task of computing the weights
$\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}$. However, in many practical applications some
simplifications apply. For example, in the case of the perturbative
coefficients of the ($\overline{\mbox{MS}}$) splitting functions there
are two simplications: the first is that $\eta=1$, the second is that
there is one single term in the sum over $i$ ($i=0$) such that and the
general form of the function $P$ is:
\begin{equation}
P^{(0)}(z,\eta)\rightarrow \frac1{1-z}\,,
\end{equation}
so that:
\begin{equation}
Q^{(0)}(a,\eta)=\ln(1-a)\,.
\end{equation}
Considering that:
\begin{equation}
w_\alpha^{(k)}(x_\beta) = \delta_{\alpha\beta}\,,
\end{equation}
and that the expressions can always be manipulated in such a way that
the coefficient of the $+$-prescripted term $S$ is a constant, one
finds that:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\beta\alpha} = \int_{c}^{d}
dz\left\{R\left(z\right)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{z}\right)+\frac{S}{1-z}\left[w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{z}\right)-\delta_{\alpha\beta}\right]\right\}+\displaystyle
\left[S\ln\left(1-c\right)+L \right]\delta_{\alpha\beta}\,.
\label{eq:SplittingFunctions}
\end{equation}

The same kind of simplifications apply to the case of the perturbative
Zero-Mass (ZM) coefficient functions with the only exception that the
sum over $i$ extends to more terms depending on the perturbative
order. For example at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, $i.e.$ at NLO, the
general form of the coefficient functions reads:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \Gamma_{\beta\alpha} &=&\displaystyle \int_{c}^{d}
                           dz\left\{R\left(z\right)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{z}\right)
  + \frac{S^{(0)}+S^{(1)}\ln(1-z)}{1-z}\left[w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{z}\right)-\delta_{\alpha\beta}\right]\right\}\\
\\
&+&\displaystyle
    \left[S^{(0)}\ln\left(1-c\right)+\frac12
    S^{(1)}\ln^2\left(1-c\right)+L \right]\delta_{\alpha\beta}\,.
\end{array}
\label{eq:ZMCoeffFunctions}
\end{equation}

Thing get more complicated when considering massive coefficient
functions. In this case, the role of $\eta$ is played by the ration
$m/Q$, where $m$ is the mass of the quark and $Q$ the hard scale. In
addition, the $+$-prescripted contributions can become more
convoluted.

As an aside, it is interesting to notice that we have silently decided
to use one of the two possible ways to compute the convolution
integral $I(x)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}). Specifically, we have chosen
the rightmost equality. However, the equality:
\begin{equation}
I(x) = x\int_x^1\frac{dz}{z} O \left(\frac{x}{z}\right) d(z)\,,
\end{equation}
is equally valid. If one choses this particular version of the
convolution integral and follows the interpolation procedure discussed
above, the result for $I$ computed in $x_\beta$ would be identical to
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv3}) (with $\eta=1$) except for the fact that the
weights $\Gamma_{\beta \alpha}$ are computed as:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\beta\alpha} = \int_{a}^{b}dz\,
O\left(\frac{x_\beta}{z}\right)w_{\alpha}^{(k)}(z)
\label{eq:oldway}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
a \equiv \mbox{max}(x_\beta,x_{\alpha-k})\quad\mbox{and}\quad b \equiv \mbox{min}(1,x_{\alpha+1})\,.
\end{equation}
This immediately implies that the integral in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv3})
and that in Eq.~(\ref{eq:oldway}) have to coincide. This is indeed the
case and the only reason to choose Eq.~(\ref{eq:Genconv3}) rather than
Eq.~(\ref{eq:oldway}) is convenience. Specifically,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:oldway}) implies computing the operator $O$ at
$x_\beta/z$ rather than at $z$ and this makes the treatment of
$\delta$-functions and $+$-distributions possibly present in $O$ a
little more delicate. However, Eq.~(\ref{eq:oldway}) remains a valid
alternative that we just decided not to pursue.

\subsection{Double convolutions}

The technique discussed above to compute convolution integrals as a
weighted sums of a given input distributions $d$ can be, under certain
circumstances, generalised to convolution integrals involving
\textit{two} distributions. Relevant examples are the Drell-Yan (DY)
and the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) cross
sections integrated over the transverse momentum of the virtual
boson. In these cases the cross section is proportional to a double
convolutions between partonic cross sections and a pair of
non-perturbative distributions. The general form of this double
convolution is:
\begin{equation}
J(x_1,x_2) =
x_1 x_2\int_{x_1}^1\frac{dy_1}{y_1}\int_{x_2}^1\frac{dy_2}{y_2}
O(y_1,y_2) d^{(1)}\left(\frac{x_1}{y_1}\right)
  d^{(2)}\left(\frac{x_2}{y_2}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Applying the same interpolation procedure as in the single-convolution
case gives:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
J(x_\delta,x_\gamma) &=&\displaystyle
\int_{x_\delta}^1dy_1\int_{x_\gamma}^1dy_2\,
O(y_1,y_2) \left[\frac{x_\delta}{y_1}d^{(1)}\left(\frac{x_\delta}{y_1}\right)\right]
  \left[\frac{x_\gamma}{y_2}d^{(2)}\left(\frac{x_\gamma}{y_2}\right)\right]\\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \sum_{\alpha=0}^{N_x}\sum_{\beta=0}^{N_x} \overline{d}^{(1)}_\beta
    \overline{d}^{(2)}_\alpha \underbrace{\left[\int_{x_\delta}^1 dy_1 \int_{x_\gamma}^1 dy_2\,
    O(y_1,y_2)\, w_{\beta}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\delta}{y_1}\right) 
    w_{\alpha}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\gamma}{y_2}\right)\right]}_{\Theta^{\beta\delta,\alpha\gamma}}\,.
\end{array}
\label{eq:DoubleZMconv}
\end{equation}
In Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleZMconv}) we have assumes that there are no mass
corrections and thus the convolutions take the simplest form. In the
case of double convolutions, the operator $O$ is a function of two
variables, $y_1$ and $y_2$, and, as in the case of the single
convolutions, it receives three kinds of contribution in both these
variables: local terms proportional to $\delta$-functions, singular
terms proportional to $+$-prescripted functions, and regular
terms. The complication here is that these contributions from the two
variables $y_1$ and $y_2$ mix and thus, for example, terms local in
$y_1$ and singular in $y_2$ may also appear. It is thus necessary to
identify the general structure of the function $O$ to see whether it
is possible to decompose the double operator
$\Theta^{\beta\delta,\alpha\gamma}$ into products of single operators.

As we will explicitly show below, in the case of SIDIS up to
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ (NLO) the general structure of the function
$O$ can be inferred looking at Eqs.~(C.2)-(C.7) of
Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:1997zj}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rclclcl}
  O(y_1,y_2) &=&\displaystyle {\rm LL}\,\delta(1-y_1)\delta(1-y_2) &+&\displaystyle {\rm LS}\,
                                                                       \delta(1-y_1)\left[\frac{\ln(1-y_2)}{1-y_2}\right]_+ &+&\displaystyle \delta(1-y_1)\,{\rm LR}(y_2) \\
  \\
             &+&\displaystyle {\rm SL}\,\left[\frac{\ln(1-y_1)}{1-y_1}\right]_+\delta(1-y_2)
                                                                   &+&\displaystyle {\rm SS}\,\left[\frac1{1-y_1}\right]_+
                                                                       \left[\frac1{1-y_2}\right]_+ &+&\displaystyle \left[\frac1{1-y_1}\right]_+\,{\rm
                                                                                                        SR}(y_2)\\
  \\
             &+&\displaystyle {\rm RL}(y_1)\,\delta(1-y_2)   &+&\displaystyle
                                                                 {\rm RS}(y_1)
                                                                 \,\left[\frac1{1-y_2}\right]_+&+&\displaystyle
                                                                                                   \sum_iK_i{\rm
                                                                                                   R}_i^{(1)}(y_1){\rm
                                                                                                   R}_i^{(2)}(y_2)\,.
\end{array}
\label{eq:DoubleFuncStruct}
\end{equation}
It is clear that in Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleFuncStruct}) all terms
factorise into a part that only depends on $y_1$ and a part that only
depends on $y_2$. This is the crucial feature that enables use the
technology developed above for the single convolutions. Plugging
Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleFuncStruct}) into Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleZMconv}), one
finds that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rclclcl}
  \Theta^{\beta\delta,\alpha\gamma} &=& {\rm LL} \,
                                        \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\beta\delta}\Gamma^{\rm L}_{\alpha\gamma}
  &+& \displaystyle {\rm LS}\,\Gamma^{\rm L}_{\beta\delta}\Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm S1}
  &+&\displaystyle \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\beta\delta} \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm LR}\\
  \\
                                    &+&{\rm SL}\,\displaystyle\Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm S1}\Gamma^{\rm L}_{\alpha\gamma}

\\
&+& \displaystyle \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm RL}\Gamma^{\rm L}_{\alpha\gamma} &+& \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm RS}\Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm
      S0} &+& \displaystyle \sum_i K_i \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{R_i^{(1)}}\Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{R_i^{(2)}}
\end{array}
\label{eq:MasterFormula}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\rm L} &=& \displaystyle  \int_{c_{\alpha\beta}}^{d_{\alpha\beta}}
                                       dz\,\delta(1-z)w_{\beta}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\alpha}{z}\right)
                                   =
                                   w_{\beta}^{(k)}\left(x_\alpha\right)
                                   =  \delta_{\alpha\beta}\\
\\
  \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{{\rm S}n} &=& \displaystyle  \int_{c_{\alpha\beta}}^{d_{\alpha\beta}}
                                       dz\frac{\ln^n(1-z)}{1-z}\left[w_{\beta}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\alpha}{z}\right)-\delta_{\alpha\beta}\right]+\frac1{(n+1)!}\ln^{n+1}\left(1-c_{\alpha\beta}\right)\delta_{\alpha\beta}\\
  \\
  \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{f} &=&\displaystyle \int_{c_{\alpha\beta}}^{d_{\alpha\beta}}
                                     dz\,f(z)\,w_{\beta}^{(k)}\left(\frac{x_\alpha}{z}\right)
\end{array}
\label{eq:PrecompOp}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is a regular function and the integration bounds are defined
as:
\begin{equation}
  c_{\alpha\beta} =
  \mbox{max}(x_\alpha,x_\alpha/x_{\beta+1}) \quad\mbox{and}\quad d_{\alpha\beta} =
  \mbox{min}(1,x_\alpha/x_{\beta-k}) \,.
\end{equation}
In general terms, we assume that it is always be possible to write an
object of the kind of $\Theta^{\beta\delta,\alpha\gamma}$ as series of
bilinear terms:
\begin{equation}
\Theta^{\beta\delta,\alpha\gamma} = \sum_j
C_j\Gamma_j^{(1),\beta\delta}\Gamma_j^{(2),\alpha\gamma}
\label{eq:OpSeries}
\end{equation}
where $C_j$ are scalar coefficients, and the weights
$\Gamma_j^{(1),\beta\delta}$ and $\Gamma_j^{(2),\alpha\gamma}$ can be
computed using the technology discussed in the previous
section. Plugging Eq.~(\ref{eq:OpSeries}) into
Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleZMconv}), one finds that:
\begin{equation}
  J(x_\delta,x_\gamma) =
  \sum_j C_j  f_j^{(1),\delta} f_j^{(2),\gamma}\,,
\label{eq:DoubleZMconv2}
\end{equation}
where we have defined:
\begin{equation}
f_j^{(1),\delta}\equiv \sum_{\beta=0}^{N_x} \overline{d}^{(1)}_\beta\Gamma_j^{(1),\beta\delta}\quad\mbox{and}\quad f_j^{(2),\gamma}\equiv \sum_{\alpha=0}^{N_x}\overline{d}^{(2)}_\alpha \Gamma_j^{(2),\alpha\gamma}\,.
\end{equation}

Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleZMconv2}) shows that, under the hypothesis that the
operator $O(y_1,y_2)$ can be expressed as a series of terms whose
dependence on $y_1$ and $y_2$ factorizes,\footnote{This is the case
  for SIDIS and DY up to NLO. However, one may expect that this
  feature holds also beyond.} the double convolution in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleZMconv}) is given by a series of bilinear
distributions ($f_j^{(1),\delta}$ and $f_j^{(2),\gamma}$) singularly
obtained as convolutions of single operators with the input
distributions $d^{(1)}$ and $d^{(2)}$. This is a particularly useful
achievement that allows us to compute double convolutions without the
need of extending the integration and the interpolation procedures to
two dimensions with an obvious gain in accuracy and performance. As a
matter of fact, the same argument can be extended to a multiple
convolution of the function $O(\{y_i\})$, which again can be expressed
as a series of $n$-linear terms, with $i=1,\dots,n$, with $n$
distributions:
\begin{equation}
J(\{x_{\alpha_i}\}) = \sum_j C_j  \prod_{i=1}^nf_j^{(i),\alpha_i}\,,
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
f_j^{(i),\alpha_i} \equiv \sum_{\beta=0}^{N_x} \overline{d}^{(i)}_\beta\Gamma_j^{(i),\beta\alpha_i}\,.
\end{equation}
This technology could be useful for more complicated observables, like
cross sections in $pp$ collisions with an identified hadron in the
final state, that requires for example three convolutions.

The challenging part of the procedure just presented resides in the
``pre-processing'' of the function $O(y_1,y_2)$ that has to be
analytically manipulated to disentangle the single terms. This step,
however, has to be taken only once.

Before going into a concrete application, it is useful to connect
Eq.~(\ref{eq:MasterFormula}) to Eq.~(\ref{eq:OpSeries}) by identifying
number and form of the coefficients and weights
involved. Specifically, assuming that the series in the last term in
the r.h.s. of Eq.~(\ref{eq:MasterFormula}) has $r$ terms, the series
in Eq.~(\ref{eq:OpSeries}) will have $8+r$ terms, that is:
\begin{equation}
\Theta^{\beta\delta,\alpha\gamma} = \sum_{j=1}^{8+r}
C_j\Gamma_j^{(1),\beta\delta}\Gamma_j^{(2),\alpha\gamma}
\label{eq:OpSeriesCon}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lclll}
j = 1 &:& C_1 = {\rm LL}, & \Gamma_1^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\beta\delta}, & \Gamma_1^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\alpha\gamma},\\
j = 2 &:& C_2 = {\rm LS}, & \Gamma_2^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\beta\delta}, & \Gamma_2^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm S1},\\
j = 3 &:& C_3 = 1, & \Gamma_3^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\beta\delta}, & \Gamma_3^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm LR},\\
j = 4 &:& C_4 = {\rm SL}, & \Gamma_4^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm S1}, & \Gamma_4^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\alpha\gamma},\\
j = 5 &:& C_5 = {\rm SS},& \Gamma_5^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm S0}, & \Gamma_5^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm S0},\\
j = 6 &:& C_6 = 1, & \Gamma_6^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm S0}, & \Gamma_6^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm SR},\\
j = 7 &:& C_7 = 1, & \Gamma_7^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm RL}, & \Gamma_7^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma^{\rm L}_{\alpha\gamma},\\
j = 8 &:& C_8 = 1, & \Gamma_8^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{\rm RS}, & \Gamma_8^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{\rm S0},\\
j = 9 &:& C_9 = K_1 & \Gamma_9^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{R_1^{(1)}}, & \Gamma_9^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{R_1^{(2)}},\\
\vdots & & & & \\
j = 8 + r &:& C_{8+r} = K_r & \Gamma_{8+r}^{(1),\beta\delta} = \Gamma_{\beta\delta}^{R_r^{(1)}}, & \Gamma_{8+r}^{(2),\alpha\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\gamma}^{R_r^{(2)}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
It should be noted that, despite the large number of terms in the
series in Eq.~(\ref{eq:OpSeriesCon}), the number of weights to be
precomputed is usually pretty limited. In addition, in many cases many
of the terms of the series are zero so that the number of
contributions is further reduced. We can now apply this procedure up
to NLO in QCD to two specific cases: SIDIS first and DY second
(incomplete).

\subsubsection{Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS)}

the structure of the ($p_T$-integrated) SIDIS cross section and the
expressions of the respective hard coefficient functions can be found
in Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:1997zj}. Following this paper, the SIDIS
differential cross section for the exchange of a virtual photon can be
written as:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^3\sigma}{dxdydz} = 
  \frac{2\, \pi\alpha^2}{xyQ^2} 
  \left[ (1+(1-y)^2) 2xF_1(x,z,Q^2) + 
    2 (1-y) F_L(x,z,Q^2) \right]\,,
\label{eq:sidis}
\end{equation}
with $Q^2 = - q^2$ the (negative) virtuality of the exchanged photon,
$x$ and $z$ the momentum fractions that enter the PDFs and the FFs,
and $y = Q^2/xs$ the inelasticity given in terms of $Q$, $x$, and the
collision energy in the center of mass $s$. Notice that, as compared
to Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:1997zj}, we have absorbed a factor $x$ into
the definition of $F_L$ as customary for the longitudinal structure
function in inclusive DIS.

We now use the Callan-Gross relation:
\begin{equation}
F_2 = 2xF_1 + F_L
\label{eq:CallanGross}
\end{equation}
to replace $2xF_1$ with $F_2$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:sidis}):
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^3\sigma}{dxdydz} = 
  \frac{2\, \pi\alpha^2}{xyQ^2} 
  \left[ Y_+ F_2(x,z,Q^2)
    -y^2 F_L(x,z,Q^2) \right]\,,
\label{eq:sidis2}
\end{equation}
where we have defined:
\begin{equation}
Y_+ = 1+(1-y)^2\,.
\end{equation}
It is also useful to write Eq.~(\ref{eq:sidis2}) as differential in
$x$, $Q^2$, and $z$:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^3\sigma}{dx\, dQ^2\, dz} = 
  \frac{2\, \pi\alpha^2}{xQ^4} 
  \left[ Y_+ F_2(x,z,Q)
    -y^2 F_L(x,z,Q) \right]\,.
\label{eq:sidis3}
\end{equation}
The structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ are given at NLO by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle  F_{2,L}(x,z,Q) &=& \displaystyle x\sum_{q,\overline{q}} e_q^2 \bigg[ q(x,Q)
    \otimes  C^{2,L}_{qq}(x,z) \otimes D_q(z,Q)  \\
&+&\displaystyle q(x,Q)  \otimes  C^{2,L}_{gq}(x,z) \otimes D_g(z,Q)+  g(x,Q)  \otimes
  C^{2,L}_{qg}(x,z) \otimes D_q(z,Q) \bigg]\,,
\end{array}
\label{eq:f1sidis}
\end {equation}
where $\{q,g\}$ are the quark and gluon PDFs and $\{D_q,D_g\}$ are the
quark and gluon FFs, $e_q$ is the electric charge of the quark $q$ and
$\{C^{2,L}_{qq},C^{2,L}_{qg},C^{2,L}_{gq}\}$ are the relevant partonic
cross sections. The partonic cross sections allow for a perturbative
expansion in power of $\alpha_s$:
\begin{equation}
C = \sum_{n=0} \left(\frac{\alpha_s}{4\pi}\right)^nC^{(n)}
\end{equation}
that we truncate to NLO, $i.e.$ to $n=1$. At LO ($n=0$) we have the simple
expression:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
C^{2,(0)}_{qq}(x,z) &=& \delta(1-x)\delta(1-z)\,,\\
\\
C^{2,(0)}_{qg}(x,z) &=&C^{2,(0)}_{gq}(x,z) = 0\,.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

At NLO ($n=1$) we take the expressions from Appendix C of
Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:1997zj} being careful to take into account an
additional factor two due to the difference in the expansion parameter
($\alpha_s/4\pi$ rather than $\alpha_s/2\pi$). We also need to combine
the expressions for $F_1$ and $F_L$ using Eq.~(\ref{eq:CallanGross})
to obtain the partonic cross sections for $F_2$. We start with the
partonic cross sections for $F_L$ that read:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_{qq}^{L,(1)} &=& 8 C_F x z\,, \\
C_{gq}^{L,(1)} &=& 8 C_F x (1-z)\,, \\
C_{qg}^{L,(1)} &=& 8 x(1-x)\,, 
\end{array}
\label{eq:cfFL}
\end{equation}
while those for $F_2$ read:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \displaystyle \frac{C_{qq}^{2,(1)}}{2C_F} &=& \displaystyle -8\delta(1-x)\delta(1-z)+2\delta(1-x)
                                  \left(\frac{\ln
                                  (1-z)}{1-z}\right)_++ 
                                  \delta(1-x) \left[\frac{1+z^2}{1-z}\ln z+(1-z)-(1+z)\ln(1-z)\right] \\
  \\
                              &+&\displaystyle 
                                  2\left(\frac{\ln
                                  (1-x)}{1-x}\right)_+\delta(1-z)+2\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)_+\left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right)_+- \left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)_+(1+z)\\
  \\
                              &+& \displaystyle \left[ 
                                  -\frac{1+x^2}{1-x}\ln x+(1-x)
                                  -(1+x)\ln(1-x)\right]\delta(1-z) -
                                  (1+x)\left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right)_++(2+6xz)\,,\\
  \\
  \displaystyle \frac{C_{gq}^{2,(1)}}{2C_F} &=& \displaystyle \delta (1-x) \left[\frac{1+(1-z)^2}{z} \ln\left[
                                               z(1-z)\right]+z\right]\\
  \\
                                            &+&\displaystyle \left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)_+\frac{1+(1-z)^2}{z}\\
  \\
                              &+&  \displaystyle 2(1+3x)-6xz-(1+x)\frac{1}{z}\,,\\
  \\
  C_{qg}^{2,(1)} &=& \displaystyle \left[(x^2+(1-x)^2)
                     \ln\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)
                     +2x(1-x)\right]\delta (1-z) +(x^2+(1-x)^2)
                     \left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right)_+\\
\\
&+&\displaystyle 2(-1+6x-6x^2) + (x^2+(1-x)^2) \frac{1}{z} \,.
\end{array}
\label{eq:cfF2}
\end{equation}
By inspection of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:cfFL}) and~(\ref{eq:cfF2}) we can
deduce the various coefficients of
Eq.~(\ref{eq:DoubleFuncStruct}). $F_L$ involves only regular functions
so that all contributions are zero but the fully regular ones:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_{qq}^{L,(1)}(x,z) &:& K_1 = 8 C_F\,,\quad R_1^{(1)}(x) = x\,,\quad
                        R_1^{(2)}(z) = z\,,\\
C_{gq}^{L,(1)}(x,z) &:& K_1 = 8 C_F\,,\quad R_1^{(1)}(x) = x\,,\quad
                        R_1^{(2)}(z) = 1-z\,,\\
C_{qg}^{L,(1)}(x,z) &:& K_1 = 8\,,\quad R_1^{(1)}(x) = x(1-x)\,,\quad
                        R_1^{(2)}(z) = 1\,.\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The situation is more complicated for $F_2$ but we can still identify
the different contributions:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_{qq}^{2,(1)} &:& \displaystyle {\rm LL} = -16 C_F\,,\quad {\rm LS} =
                        4C_F\,,\quad {\rm LR}(z) = 2C_F
                        \left[\frac{1+z^2}{1-z}\ln
                        z+(1-z)-(1+z)\ln(1-z)\right]\\
\\
&& \displaystyle {\rm SL} = 4C_F\,,\quad {\rm SS} = 4C_F\,,\quad {\rm
   SR}(z) = -2C_F(1+z)\\
\\
&& \displaystyle {\rm RL}(x) = 2C_F \left[ 
                                  -\frac{1+x^2}{1-x}\ln x+(1-x)
                                  -(1+x)\ln(1-x)\right]\,,\quad {\rm
   RS}(x) = -2C_F(1+x)\,,\\
\\
&& \displaystyle \left\{K_1 =  4C_F,\, R_1^{(1)}(x) = 1,\,
   R_1^{(2)}(z) = 1\right\}\,,\\
\\
&& \displaystyle \left\{K_2 =  12C_F,\, R_2^{(1)}(x) = x,\,
   R_2^{(2)}(z) = z\right\}\,,\\
\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_{gq}^{2,(1)} &:& \displaystyle {\rm LR}(z) = 2C_F\left[\frac{1+(1-z)^2}{z} \ln\left[
                                               z(1-z)\right]+z\right]\,,\\
  \\
&& \displaystyle {\rm SR}(z) = 2C_F\left[\frac{1+(1-z)^2}{z}\right]\,,\\
\\
&& \displaystyle \left\{K_1 =  4C_F,\, R_1^{(1)}(x) = 1 + 3x,\,
   R_1^{(2)}(z) = 1\right\}\,,\\
\\
&& \displaystyle \left\{K_2 =  -12C_F,\, R_2^{(1)}(x) = x,\,
   R_2^{(2)}(z) = z\right\}\,,\\
\\
&& \displaystyle \left\{K_3 =  -2C_F,\, R_3^{(1)}(x) = 1+x,\,
   R_3^{(2)}(z) = \frac1{z}\right\}\,,\\
\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_{qg}^{2,(1)} &:&\displaystyle {\rm RL}(x) = \left[x^2+(1-x)^2\right]
                     \ln\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)
                     +2x(1-x)\,,\quad  {\rm RS}(x) = x^2+(1-x)^2\,,\\
\\
&& \displaystyle \left\{K_1 = 2,\, R_1^{(1)}(x) = - 1 + 6x-6x^2,\,
   R_1^{(2)}(z) = 1\right\}\,,\\
\\
&& \displaystyle \left\{K_2 =  1,\, R_2^{(1)}(x) = x^2+(1-x)^2,\,
   R_2^{(2)}(z) = \frac1{z}\right\}\,.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Analogously, for the only LO partonic cross sections we find that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_{qq}^{2,(0)} &:& \displaystyle {\rm LL} =1 \,.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
All the coefficients that are not mentioned are equal to zero. We can
now explicitly implement Eq.~(\ref{eq:MasterFormula}). The one thing
that is left to sort out is the structure of $F_2$ and $F_L$ in terms
of the appropriate PDF and FF combinations. Looking
Eq.~(\ref{eq:f1sidis}), we observe that none of the coefficient
functions depends on the particular quark flavour (this is a feature
of the ZM scheme). Therefore, simplifying the notation, we can rewrite
Eq.~(\ref{eq:f1sidis}) as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
  \displaystyle  F &=& \displaystyle C_{qq}  \sum_{q} e_q^2 \left[q  D_q +\overline{q}  D_{\overline{q}}\right]  + C_{gq}  \sum_{q} e_q^2
                       \left[q+\overline{q}\right]\,D_g  +  C_{qg}  g \sum_{q} e_q^2
                       \left [D_q +D_{\overline{q}}\right]\,,
\end{array}
\label{eq:structF2L}
\end {equation}
where now the sums run only over the quark flavours and not over the
antiflavours.

\subsubsection{Drell Yan (DY)}

In this section we apply to the Drell-Yan (DY) process the same
procedure followed above for SIDIS. As a matter of fact, SIDIS and DY
are strictly connected in that DY can be regarded as the time-like
counterpart of SIDIS. As a consequence, the structure of the relevant
observables as well as the form of the expressions involved are very
similar. Therefore, the application of the method described above is
straightforward. 

\subsection{Advantage of a logarithmic grid}

Given the particular structure of the integral $I$ in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}), it turns out to be very convenient to use a
logarithmically distributed grid along with Lagrange interpolating
functions. Let us specifically consider the (massless) integrals:
\begin{equation}
I_{\beta\alpha} =
\int_{x_\beta}^1dy\,O(y)w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\,.
\label{eq:integralex}
\end{equation}
A logarithmically-spaced grid is defined such that
$\ln x_{n+1}=\ln x_{n}+\delta x$ with $\delta x$ a positive
constant. In addition, we consider a set of Lagrange interpolating
functions of degree $\kappa$ polynomial in $\ln z$,
$\{w_{\alpha}(z)\}$, that thus have the following form (see section on
the interpolation):
\begin{equation}
  w_{\alpha}^{(k)}(z) = \sum_{j=0\atop j \leq
    \alpha}^{k}\theta(z-x_{\alpha-j})\theta(x_{\alpha-j+1}-z)\prod^{k}_{\delta=0\atop \delta\ne
    j}\left[\frac{\ln(z)-\ln(x_{\alpha-j+\delta})}{\ln(x_{\alpha})-\ln(x_{\alpha-j+\delta})}\right]\,.
\label{eq:LagrangeFormulaLog}
\end{equation}
Due to the fact that the grid is logarithmically distributed with step
$\delta x$, the function above can be rearranged as follows:
\begin{equation}
w_{\alpha}^{(k)}(z) = \sum_{j=0\atop j \leq \alpha}^{k}\theta(z-x_{\alpha-j})\theta(x_{\alpha-j+1}-z)\prod^{k}_{\delta=0\atop \delta\ne j}\left[\frac{1}{\delta x} \ln\left(\frac{z}{x_\alpha}\right)\frac{1}{j-\delta}+1\right].
\end{equation}
It is finally easy to see that Eq.~(\ref{eq:LagrangeFormulaLog}) is
such that:
\begin{equation}
w_{\alpha}(z) =
\widetilde{w}\left(\ln\frac{z}{x_\alpha}\right)\quad\Rightarrow\quad
w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right) =
\widetilde{w}\left(\ln\frac{x_\beta}{x_\alpha}-\ln y\right)
=\widetilde{w}\left((\beta-\alpha)\delta x-\ln y\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the integrand of the integral in Eq.~(\ref{eq:integralex})
only depends on the difference $\beta-\alpha$ and not on $\beta$ and
$\alpha$ separately. Since the lower bound is $x_\beta$, this symmetry
seems to broken at the level of the integral.  However, the symmetry
is preserved thanks to the support properties of the interpolating
functions $w_\alpha$ and the fact that the relevant functions (PDFs or
FFs) are zero at $x=1$. To see this, we consider the integration
limits in Eq.~(\ref{eq:intlims}) with $\eta=1$. They can be written
as:
\begin{equation}
  c =
  \mbox{max}(x_\beta,e^{(\beta-\alpha-1)\delta x}) \quad\mbox{and}\quad d =
  \mbox{min}(1,e^{(\beta-\alpha+\kappa)\delta x}) \,.
\label{eq:intlims1}
\end{equation}
While the limit $d$ is manifestly only dependent on the difference
$\beta-\alpha$, the limit $c$ is not. However, $c$ does not have this
symmetry only when $x_\beta$ is selected in place of
$e^{(\beta-\alpha-1)\delta x}$ and this can only happen when:
\begin{equation}
x_\beta > e^{(\beta-\alpha-1)\delta x}\,.
\label{eq:ineq}
\end{equation}
Since the last point of the grid is $x_{N_x}=1$, being $N_x$ the
number of grid intervals, one can write:
\begin{equation}
x_\beta = \frac{x_\beta}{x_{N_x}} = e^{(\beta-N_x)\delta x}.
\end{equation}
Finally, relying on the monotonicity of the exponential function, the
inequality in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ineq}) becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \beta-N_x > \beta-\alpha-1\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \alpha > N_x-1\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \alpha = N_x\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the integrals $I_{\beta N_x}$ do not respect the
``$\beta-\alpha$'' symmetry.  However, as mentioned above,
$I_{\beta N_x}$ will always multiply a function computed in
$x_{N_x}=1$. In all cases of interest this function is identically
zero at $x_{N_x}=1$ and thus the symmetry is effectively preserved. In
addition, $c$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:intlims1}) is such that if
$\beta>\alpha$ one has $c\geq1$. But being $c$ the lower integration
bound of and since in Eq.~(\ref{eq:integralex}) the upper bound is 1,
one immediately has that $I_{\beta\alpha}=0$ for $\beta>\alpha$. The
consequence of these observations is that computing the integrals
$a_\alpha=I_{0\alpha}$ for $\alpha=0,\dots,N_x$ is enough to
reconstruct the full set of integrals $I_{\beta\alpha}$ because, in
matricial representation, $I$ will look like this:
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle I_{\beta\alpha} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a_0 &  a_1 & a_2 & \cdots & a_{N_x} \\
 0  & a_0 & a_1 & \cdots & a_{N_x-1} \\
 0  & 0   &  a_0 & \cdots & a_{N_x-2} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 0  &   0  &   0 & \cdots & a_0 
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\label{eq:MatrixRep}
\end{equation}
In conclusion, adopting a logarithmically-spaced grid allows one to
compute $N_x+1$ integrals rather than $(N_x+1)(N_x+2)/2$ integrals.

There is another aspect that matters in terms of numerical efficiency
of the computation of the integrals $I_{\beta\alpha}$. Given the
support region of the interpolating functions $w_\alpha$, the integral
in Eq.~(\ref{eq:integralex}) effectively reads:
\begin{equation}
I_{\beta\alpha} = \int_c^ddy\,O(y)w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
with the integration limits given in Eq.~(\ref{eq:intlims}). These
limits can be rearranged as follows:
\begin{equation}
  c=\frac{x_\beta}{x_{{\rm min}[N_x,\alpha+1]}}\quad\mbox{and}\quad
  {d} = \frac{x_\beta}{x_{{\rm max}[\beta,\alpha-\kappa]}}\,,
\label{eq:intlimsind}
\end{equation}
which makes it manifest the index range covered by the integration
range. The basic observation is that the functions $w_\alpha$ are
piecewise in correspondence of the grid nodes. This feature makes a
numerical integration over the full range defined in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:intlimsind}) hard to converge due to the cusps at the
grid nodes. However, the functions $w_\alpha$ are smooth between two
consecutive nodes. Therefore, it turns out to be convenient to compute
the integrals $I_{\beta\alpha}$ by breaking the integration range as
follows:
\begin{equation}
I_{\beta\alpha} = \sum_{j={\rm max}[0, \alpha + 1 - N_x]}^{{\rm
    min}[\kappa, \alpha - \beta]}
\int_{x_\beta/x_{\alpha-j+1}}^{x_\beta/x_{\alpha-j}}
dy\,O(y)w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\,,
\label{eq:finalformula}
\end{equation}
in such a way that the integrand of each single integral is a smooth
function and thus easier to integrate. Despite the number of
intergrals to be computed increases, this procedure makes the
computation faster and more accurate. Finally, if the grid is
logarithmically distributed, and one defines:
\begin{equation}
s = \exp\left[\delta x\right]\,,
\end{equation}
Eq.~(\ref{eq:finalformula}) can also be written as:
\begin{equation}
I_{\beta\alpha} = \sum_{j={\rm max}[0, \alpha + 1 - N_x]}^{{\rm
    min}[\kappa, \alpha - \beta]}  \int_{s^{\beta -\alpha + j-1}}^{s^{\beta -\alpha + j}} dy\,O(y)w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
These are the basic objects computed by {\tt APFEL++} to define a
DGLAP-like operator.

\section{GPD-related integrals}

When considering computations involving GPDs, another kind of integral
structure comes into play, that is:
\begin{equation}
J(x) = x\int_0^1\frac{dz}{z} O \left(\frac{x}{z},x\right) d(z)\,.
\label{eq:ZMconvERBL}
\end{equation}
This integral differs from that in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}) in two
respects: the lower integration bound is zero rather than $x$ and the
operator $O$ may also depend explicitly on the external variable
$x$. These differences make the strategy devised for the numerical
computation of convolution integrals as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv})
partially invalid. Let us discuss it in detail to motivate the
particular strategy adopted to compute Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL}) on a
grid.

As discussed above, logarithmically distributed grids are particularly
advantageous for integrals like those in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}) because
they allow for a substantial reduction of the number of integrals to
be computed. However, logarithmic grids have two main
drawbacks. First, logarithmic grids that start from a relatively low
value of $x$ tend to be relatively sparse at large values of $x$. This
is a problem because all integrals that we are considering are such
that the function being interpolated is integrated up to $x=1$ and the
interpolation there can thus potentially degrade in accuracy. A
possible solution to this problem is to increase the density in a
stepwise fashion as $x$ gets closer to one. This produces locally
logarithmically distributed grids that allow one to exploit the
symmetry discussed above while making the grid denser, and thus more
accurate, at large $x$. The implementation of this procedure in {\tt
  APFEL++} is achieved by means of \textit{locked} subgrids. In
practice, one starts with a logarithmic grid with a given lower bound,
\textit{e.g.}  $x_{\rm min}^{(0)}=10^{-5}$. Starting from a given
node, $x_{\rm min}^{(1)}$, the density of the grid is increased by
some integer factor. This procedure can be repeated an arbitrary
number of times as one moves towards large $x$, effectively defining
logarithmic subgrids that are increasingly denser and thus guarantee a
better interpolation accuracy. When dealing with integrals such as
that in Eq.~(\ref{eq:integralex}), the simplest way to exploit the
subgrid structure is to switch to a denser grid at the level of the
\textit{integral}, essentially using one grid when $x_\beta$ is below
the transition node and the other when it is above. The advantage of
this approach is that the integration procedure discussed above
applies verbatim with the only difference that, according to the
position of $x_\beta$, one grid is used rather than another. The
disadvantage of this procedure is that integrals with low values of
$x_\beta$ do not take advantage of the denser grids at large $x$. When
dealing with functions like PDFs that vanish rapidly as $x$ tends to
one, this is typically fine because the bulk of the integrals is
typically due to the region at $x\gtrsim x_\beta$. This usually makes
possible interpolation inaccuracies at large $x$
negligible. Unfortunately, when applied to integrals of the kind of
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL}), this strategy may lead to severe
inaccuracies at large values of $x_\beta$. This is due to the fact
that the integral extends down to zero and this procedure does not
make use of the low-$x$ grids, effectively truncating the integral to
increasingly larger values of $x$ as $x_\beta$ approaches one.

The second problem is that logarithmic grids get down to $x = 0$. This
is not an issue for the computation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}) because
the lower integration bound is $x$ and thus, as long as the integral
in not computed below the lower bound of the grid, this does not
introduce any inaccuracy. Conversely, this is a potential problem for
integrals like those in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL}) that extend down to
zero for any value of $x$. This may suggest that logarithmic grids are
not suitable in the first place for integrals as in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL}). However, we observe that GPD-related
integrands are usually well-behaved around $y=0$ implying that a
logarithmic grid with lower bound $x_0$ close enough to zero
(\textit{e.g.}  $x_0=10^{-5}$) is expected to be enough to make the
contribution to the integral due to the region $y\in[0,x_0]$
negligibly small. Therefore, also for the computation of
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL}), we stick to logarithmically distributed
grids which allows us to use the same class for constructing and
managing grids developed to compute Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconv}).

In addition, GPD-related integrals, due to the explicit dependence on
the external variable of the operator (see Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL})),
do not enjoy $\beta-\alpha$ symmetry discussed above. This is a major
limitation in that it does not allow us to reduce the number of
integrals to be computed.

These observation, along with the discussion on the interpolation
grid, leads us to take an approach in which the operator is computed
for all possible pairs $(\alpha,\beta)$ over a grid that extends as
low as possible in $x$ and is dense at large $x$: \textit{i.e.} the
joint grid.

Using the usual interpolation formula gives us that the integral in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL}) is computed on the grid as follows:
\begin{equation}
J(x_\beta) = \sum_{\alpha=}^{N_x-1}J_{\beta\alpha}\overline{d}_\alpha\,.
\end{equation}
with $\overline{d}_\alpha = x_\alpha d(x_\alpha)$ and the assumption
$d(1)=0$, and with:
\begin{equation}
J_{\beta\alpha} =
\sum_{j=0}^{{\rm min}[\alpha,\kappa]}\int_{x_\beta/x_{\alpha-j+1}}^{x_\beta/x_{\alpha-j}} dy\,O(y,x_\beta)w_\alpha^{(\kappa)}\left(\frac{x_\beta}{y}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where the indices $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are intended to run over the
joint grid. We point out again that in this case it is necessary to
compute all the $N_x^2$ integrals making up $J_{\beta\alpha}$.

\subsection{Principal-valued integrals}

Expressions for the operator $O$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZMconvERBL}) often
involve singular terms that are to interpreted as Cauchy
principal-valued distributions. We are specifically concerned with
integrals of the following kind:
\begin{equation}
I={\rm PV}\int_x^{\infty}dy\,\frac{f(y)}{1-y}\,
\end{equation}
where $f(y)$ is a smooth function over the integration range. In order
to numerically treat this kind of integrals, in the document devoted
to GPDs the so-called $++$-distribution has been introduced such that:
\begin{equation}
I=\int_x^{\infty}dy\,\left(\frac{1}{1-y}\right)_{++}f(y)\,
\end{equation}
Similarly to the popular $+$-distribution, the $++$-distribution acts
upon integration in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\int_x^{\infty}dy\,\left(\frac{1}{1-y}\right)_{++}f(y) =
\int_x^{\infty}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[f(y)-f(1)\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+f(1)\ln(1-x)
\,.
\label{eq:pluplusprescription}
\end{equation}
However, differently from the $+$-distribution, the $++$-distribution
does not regularise an otherwise divergen integral. It rather
rearranges the integrand in such a way that it is finite over the
integration range (the divergence at $y=1$ is no longer there) making
it numerically treatable. We now need to devise a way to compute this
integral within the interpolation framework. Indeed, the interpolation
procedure produces integrals as this:
\begin{equation}
I_{\beta\alpha}=\int_{x_{\beta}}^{\infty}dy\,\left(\frac{1}{1-y}\right)_{++}w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right) \,,
\end{equation}
that need to be treated with care due to the support region of the
interpolation functions $w_\alpha$. In particular, we know that the
function $w_\alpha(x_\beta/y)$ has support
$y\in [x_\beta/x_{\alpha+1},x_\beta/x_{\alpha-\kappa}]$, so that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
I_{\beta\alpha}&=&\displaystyle
                   \int_{c}^{d}dy\,\left(\frac{1}{1-y}\right)_{++}w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)=\int_{c}^{\infty}dy\,\left(\frac{1}{1-y}\right)_{++}w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)\\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \int_c^{\infty}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)-\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+\delta_{\beta\alpha}\ln(1-c)\\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \int_c^{d}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)-\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left[\ln(1-c)-\int_d^{\infty}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]\\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \int_c^{d}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)-\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left[\ln(1-c)-\int_d^{\infty}dy\left(\frac{1}{1-y}+\frac{1}{y}\right)\right]\\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \int_c^{d}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)-\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left[\ln(1-c)-\int^{1-d}_{-\infty}\frac{dz}{z}-\int_d^{\infty}\frac{dy}{y}\right] \\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \int_c^{d}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)-\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left[\ln(1-c)+\int_{1-d}^{d}\frac{dy}{y}\right] \\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \int_c^{d}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)-\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left[\ln(1-c)+\int_{d-1}^{d}\frac{dy}{y}\right] \\
\\
&=&\displaystyle
    \int_c^{d}\frac{dy}{1-y}\left[w_{\alpha}\left(\frac{x_{\beta}}{y}\right)-\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left(1+\theta(y-1)\frac{1-y}{y}\right)\right]+\delta_{\beta\alpha}\left[\ln(1-c)-\ln\left(1-\frac{1}{d}\right)\right] \,,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
c = \frac{x_\beta}{x_{\alpha+1}}\quad\mbox{and}\quad d = \frac{x_\beta}{x_{\alpha-\rm{min}[\alpha,\kappa]}}\,,
\end{equation}
and where we have used the fact that $d\geq 1$ for $\beta=\alpha$ and,
according to the Cauchy principal-value prescription:
\begin{equation}
\int_{-a}^{a}\frac{dy}{y} = 0\,,
\end{equation}
where $a$ could also be $\infty$.
